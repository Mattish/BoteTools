# BoteTools
Tools for modding World of Warships. These tools are no way endorsed by Wargaming.

__I am not responsible for any wacky or bad(or good) things that happen to your game. You accept full responsibility for using these applications. I may or may not keep this up to date with changes made to the game.__

## Features / To Do

In no particular order, striked out is completed 

* ~~Replace SFX~~
* Manage information on assembly and game files
* Prevent and maintain proper game files when new versions/file changes
* Manage SFX modifications
* Manage Skin modifications

## Sound
This section is for all things to do with sound. The files used by World of Warships are .wem files with ogg as their internal format. The internal format for ogg is required for them to play in the game. I do not provide ways to create these files and you will need to do that yourself.
